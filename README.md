Just Raleigh
=============

![](logo.png)

This Chrome extension replaces all occurrences of "Raleigh-Durham" (the airport) with "Raleigh" (the city).

It is based on the excellent [Cloud-to-Butt extension by Steven Frank](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

[Just Raleigh is now live in the Chrome Web Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-raleigh/eepabfedajlljfllelejdjpgieknajoc).
